# Module 1 - Coding Standards

## Reflection 1
This module, especially in exercise 1, gave me the chance to apply the concepts that were taught in class and in the module.
I was particularly fond of applying clean code principles to my code by making them as intuitive and as descriptive as they could be.
For instance, function names such as findById, update, and delete are variables names which are clear to me as they serve handle one well-defined goal of a product.
Another implementation of the module which I enjoyed was applying separation of concerns such as separating controller, model, repository, and service.
These helped me a lot since debugging an error would only require me to fix the exact file of where that bug occurred while maintaining readability between each package.

Other than clean code, I also managed to practice lessons from git flow and secure coding.
I learned that each feature should be its own branch to ensure modularity through git flow.
Applying secure coding taught me to think of possible cases where things may go unplanned.
Overall, I think I managed to apply the lessons from this module well so far. If I could change a few things and if I had more time, I may think of more cases to make sure my code is robust.
